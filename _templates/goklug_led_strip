Device has to be configured via this method: https://tasmota.github.io/docs/TuyaMCU/ because there is a separate MCU present.

Following fnID-to-dpID-mapping makes the basic functions work:

dpID | datatype | fnID | note
--- | --- | --- | ---
20 | 1 | 11 | Relay (on/off)
22 | 2 | 21 | Brightness (use 'Backlog Dimmer 10; Dimmer 1000' command to enable dimmer)
24 | 3 | 24 | RGB (Test with TuyaSend3 24,ff0000646464ff)

"
fnID-to-dpID-mapping may be not complete but covers basic functions (on/off; RGB; Brightness)
Following dpIDs are available additionally but functions are not known (at least to me):

dpID | datatype | note
--- | --- | --- 
21 | 4 | --
23 | 2 | RX value 500, Value doesn't change in console
26 | 2 | shows sometimes values that are not 0

Feel free to include that information, it could help somebody to find the last pieces of information"
