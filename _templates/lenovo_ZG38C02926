The device comes with a newer Tuya firmware and tuya-convert does not work. One needs to disassemble the device and flash using serial method (soldering required).

To flash it you need to open the plastic case (it splits in half, use a tiny screwdriver to pry from the 4-pin strip connector end. You'll probably break a couple of the tiny plastic tabs in the corners. Inside there is a TYWE3S module; connect 3.3Vcc, GND, Tx, Rx and pull GPIO0 to GND while flashing.

GPIOs are mapped to the following:

PWM1 (R): GPIO4
PWM2 (G): GPIO12
PWM3 (B): GPIO14
Button: GPIO0
